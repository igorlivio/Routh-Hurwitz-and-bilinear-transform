## Routh-Hurwitz-and-bilinear-transform 

Part of an university assignment of Linear Systems Analysis lecture that got into the boulevard of forgotten folders of my pc.

As far as I remember the code checks if the inserted polinomio matches the Routhâ€“Hurwitz stability criterion for a linear time invariant (LTI) control system. If the polinomio is set in continuous-time it calculates the bilinear transform to discrete-time. 

Use it as long as it makes you happy :)
